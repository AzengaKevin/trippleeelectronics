- Use a simple checkbox to include tax option on an order
- Each item and item variant should be connected to all the tax options available
- When the product tax option is included computer the tax and save it on the order item
- Taxes should tied to jurisdictions
- Start by creating jurisdictions because the tax table requires jurisdictions table
- Add extra columns to order to capture the tax_amount column
- Add an extra column to the order item the tax_amount column
- Use the same table to handle both item and item-variant tax relationship
